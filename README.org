org-blog-mode is an emacs client for [[https://github.com/lane-s/org-blog][org-blog]]

It's one part of a larger system that allows you to blog directly from org-mode! It also defines a new major mode for managing blog posts.

* Installation

The package is not currently on MELPA. I'll submit a recipe if more people become interested.

For now, just clone the repo and load org-blog-mode.el

If you're using spacemacs, add the following to your ~dotspacemacs-additional-packages~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-blog 
:location (recipe 
           :fetcher github
           :repo "lane-s/org-blog-mode"))
#+END_SRC
